Participating in RoboCup (2016-2018) I was working on improving the object perception pipeline for the domestic service robot (Care-O-bot 3). Typical task was to program the robot to manipulate a set of household objects (not known prior to the competition).

For this task the pipeline we used was first to detect an object with a 3D camera (points outlying the surface, table, etc were found), and get a cropped RGB image of the detected object(s) only. Then the RGB image was classified with a CNN. To train the classifying CNN, we had to quickly collect a photo dataset of all the objects used in the competition, and train the CNN with dataset augmentation techniques.
