Adaptive optics (AO) – was my main focus at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology of Behavior and the topic of my PhD dissertation.

Imaging in fluorescent microscopy relies on focusing light inside the sample with the objective. However when encountering tissue in biological samples, light gets scattered and deflected off its path resulting in broader and dimmer (aberrated) focus, not suitable for imaging. Adaptive optics is a technique of compensating sample aberration such that sharp focus is restored allowing imaging despite the aberration of the sample.

The main problem, however is discovering the correction needed for a particular imaging site. This can be regarded as an inverse problem of finding an aberration from its resulting effect on the images.
In my thesis I have explored two diefferent approaches to this problem.

**Machine learning approach** - correction is predicted by a trained newural network:

**Differentiable optics approach** - correction is found by optimization of the microscope model:
