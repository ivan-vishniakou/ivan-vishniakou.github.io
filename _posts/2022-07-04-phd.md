Defended my PhD at the Univerity of Bonn! It has been an exciting and fun journey where I met many great people. So thankful to my supervisors Dr. Johannes Seelig and Prof. Matthias Hullin, and all the colleagues and freinds who supported me!

For me it was a thrilling dive into machne learning, signal processing and physical optics modelling, when I got to work on adaptive optics for fluorescent laser scanning microscope.
